          <p>
            There are about 2000 types of cacti, and they come in different
            shapes, sizes, and colors. Green may be the most common color for
            cacti, but they can also be bluish or brown-green. Some cactus
            plants are very round, and others are flat like a pancake. Some are
            even shaped like snakes or starfish. A cactus plant can be very
            small or very big. The largest type of cacti can grow to be 66 feet
            tall and weigh up to 4800 pounds. Thatâ€™s as heavy as a car!

          <h3 class="sectionTitle">What is special about a cactus</h3>
          <p>
            The cactus is a type of plant called a succulent. This means that it
            can store water in its stems, roots, and leaves. Even if it doesn't
            rain for a long time, the cactus still has water saved up to help it
            grow. Thanks to its ability to store water, the cactus can live for
            over a year without rain!
